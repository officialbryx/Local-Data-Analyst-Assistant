Providing automation solution for my laziness and reduce heavy workload :P

Local LLM (for SQL + explanations)

Run a lightweight SQL-focused LLM locally (sqlcoder, mistral, or llama3 via Ollama or GPT4All).

Input: natural language (“Show me the average sales per region for 2023”).

Output: optimized MySQL SQL query.

Database Connection Layer

Use Python (mysql-connector-python or SQLAlchemy) to connect directly to your MySQL DB.

Execute queries returned by the LLM.

Data Export & Visualization

Store results into:

CSV → synced with Google Drive → Looker Studio reads it.

Or directly push results into Google Sheets using API.

Optional: Generate local preview charts with matplotlib / plotly before exporting.

Automation UI

Start simple: Python script in terminal.

Later: build a Streamlit or Flask web UI on your laptop where you can type queries and see results instantly.

I'll work on it later. I'm sleepy atm -_-
